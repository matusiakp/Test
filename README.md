## X-Y-Axis Modification <a name="head1"></a>
I have printed a few enhancements for the Tronxy X5S to improve the XY axis. 
Thanks to these modifications, I improved the stability of the carriage and better belt guidance. 
All information about assembly can be found on the thingiverse (link below).
Also I printed a new mount for motor. I was inspired by <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2717656">SgaboLab</a> idea, 
but I improved the design by strengthening the structure and improving the assembly. 
Remember to print the second motor tower as a mirror.<br><br>

## Z-Axis Modification <a name="head2"></a>
Another important right was to stabilize the table, which at first could lose its level. 
For best result I bought linear slide bearing RJ4JP-01 from igus (x16) and trapezoidal nut eliminating play (x2).
Important issue is to remove the stabilizer bearing that stresses the trapezoidal bolt.
This mods allowed me to obtain a rigid table structure.

## Glass and Bed Holders <a name="head3"></a>
The standard printing bed of the Tronxy X5S may be OK for the first steps in 3D printing. 
But you will quickly realize that the filament does not stick well to it and changing the blue-tape constantly is also not an option. 
For this reason, you should get a glass bed. Borosilicate glass is your weapon of choice, because it is shows high chemical resistance 
and allows for high temperatures. Glass with Dimafix guaranted very good adhesion of the first layer to the table. You can also print my
holder for Dimafix can. For fast bed level I printed a Knob.<br>

## Increase the stability <a name="head4"></a>
Mounting bracket in the corners is an easy and cheap fix to increase the stability of the Tronxy X5S. 
Because the Tronxy X5S is quite high and the main emphasis is mostly also on the top
I created that brace to stabilize the frame for fast, short movements (my version is a modification
project from thingiverse, it is smaller so I could mount it in every corner). On the thingiverse you can find 
another corner bracket you can choose the version you like best.
Adding this simple Tronxy X5S upgrade will prevent the frame from flexing and increase the quality of your prints.

## Top Mount Cable Chain <a name="head5"></a>
While mounting my X5S i found that the cable chain weight pull up the carriage to one side and presses on belt ,so i printed part to mount it on top , 
it also uses less chain. For this mod you must buy two 608 bearings.

## Spool and Filament Holder <a name="head6"></a>
For the efficient replacement of the filament, I was able to combine three very good solutions from thingiverse.

Firs is a Master Spool. It is a reusable spool for which you can buy cheaper filament for example "Refill Fiberlogy".
The main advantages are cost and reduced waste. You are also being kinder to the 
environment by reducing waste.  You will no longer have an empty spool to deal with.

Second is Spool Hub, designed to make spool change-outs quick and easy. 
Accommodates spools with a center hole of 50mm - 65mm.

Third is Filament spool holder to shorten the distance between the spool and the extruder.

## MOSFET for Hotend and Bed <a name="head7"></a>
The addition of a MOSFET is one of the most important Tronxy X5S upgrades you can buy. 
The most common use of the MOSFET with the Tronxy X5S 3D printer is to regulate the high workload 
that the heated bed places upon the mainboard. The high current of the hot bed can lead 
to stress for the mainboard connectors, and increases the possibility of a fire hazard 
or hardware malfunction. Aside from the safety benefits, the MOSFET also allows users to 
apply a second power supply unit (PSU), which will drastically reduce the time it takes 
your heated bed to reach its set temperature. I used to two MOSFET for Bed and Hotend for reduce current
on the mainboard.

## Power Switch Mount and Power Supply Holder <a name="head8"></a>
This might seem like a simple addition to the Tronxy X5S, but a power switch should be welcomed 
by 3D printer users with open arms. It is a great protection in the event of a short circuit because 
the switch contains a fuse.  I designed my own bracket for mounting the power supply on the plate at the back of the printer, 
which also has the ability to mount power switch.

## Power Supply 24V for Bed <a name="head9"></a>
Great upgrade is to add a 24V power supply. I have original 12V power supply for hotend and electronic and another
24V power supply only for bed. Using a 24V power supply unit, you can heat your print bed to a 100 C in 6 to 9 minutes.
To be able to connect the 24V power supply, it is important to solder the cables under the table in the configuration for 24v.
Please note, that you should buy a power supply unit with a current rating of at least 20A / 480W, or even better 25A / 600W.

To reduce temperature dispersion, I buy a Self-Adhesive Aluminum Insulation Mat 300mm x 300mm.
These lightweight insulation mats work really well to keep your 3D printer beds warm throughout the printing process. 
Rather than have your print bed overcompensate for a cool room, and require extra heating, we can keep that heat in better.

## Fan Cooler and Hotend Mount <a name="head11"></a>
When 3D printing with certain materials, a nozzle fan helps to cool freshly extruded plastic and 
keep the 3D print in tip-top quality. In its stock format, the Tronxy X5S does include one of these fans, 
but the original cooling fan blows only from one direction. 
A more efficient cooling fan can easily be 3D printed. To cool printed filament from two directions, 
you can print this Tronxy X5S upgrade. This unique design blows air from two sides towards the nozzle, 
greatly improving the overall quality of your 3D prints.
