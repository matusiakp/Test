# Tronxy X5S Upgrades and Mods

Want to improve your Tronxy X5S? I want to present my upgrades and mods for Tronxy X5S which 
I made on my printer to improve the quality of the prints.

## X-Y-Axis Modification <a name="head1"></a>
I have printed a few enhancements for the Tronxy X5S to improve the XY axis. 
Thanks to these modifications, I improved the stability of the carriage and better belt guidance. 
All information about assembly can be found on the thingiverse (link below) </a> <br>
Also I printed a nem mount for motor. I was inspired by <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2717656">SgaboLab</a> idea, 
but I improved the design by strengthening the structure and improving the assembly. <br><br>

## Z-Axis Modification <a name="head2"></a>
Another important right was to stabilize the table, which at first could lose its level. 
In addition, I bought linear slide bearing RJ4JP-01 from igus (x16) and trapezoidal nut eliminating play (x2).
Important issue is to remove the stabilizer bearing that stresses the trapezoidal bolt.
This mods allowed me to obtain a rigid table structure. <br><br>

## Glass and Bed Holders <a name="head3"></a>
The standard printing bed of the Tronxy X5S may be OK for the first steps in 3D printing. 
But you will quickly realize that the filament does not stick well to it and changing the blue-tape constantly is also not an option. 
For this reason, you should get a glass bed. Borosilicate glass is your weapon of choice, because it is shows high chemical resistance 
and allows for high temperatures. Glass with Dimafix guaranted very good adhesion of the first layer to the table. You can also print my
holder for Dimafix Can.<br><br>

## Increase the stability <a name="head4"></a>
Mounting bracket in the corners is an easy and cheap fix to increase the stability of the Tronxy X5S. 
Because the Tronxy X5S is quite high and the main emphasis is mostly also on the top
I created that brace to stabilize the frame for fast, short movements (my version is a modification
project from thingiverse, it is smaller so I could mount it in every corner). On the thingiverse you can find 
another corner bracket you can choose the version you like best.
Adding this simple Tronxy X5S upgrade will prevent the frame from flexing and increase the quality of your prints.
